## Thanks for downloading ProvisionIRCd, an mIRC based IRC Daemon.   ##
## This is the example file. It is required that you edit this file  ##
## and rename it to "ircd.conf" to make the IRCd work.               ##
## For any questions/requests, you can always visit our website,     ##
## on http://provisionircd.no-ip.org                                 ##
##                                                                   ##
## Do NOT edit/remove the info between the '[' and ']' characters!   ##
## This will make the IRCd not to work, or work incorrectly!         ##
##                                                                   ##
